That's the motto I keep up in my mind. And to learn & practice more about the field of data engineering, I found [Data-Engineering-Practice](https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice) repository by [Daniel](https://github.com/danielbeach).

These are really well crafted exercises for any data enthusiast who wants to level up their data engineering skills.

I am currently working on these exercises and improving my data engineering skills. I will be posting exercise solutions in this repository as soon as I complete.

This is a really good upskilling experience for me. Keep up with me for more updates.

Thank You!
